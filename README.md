Simple Password List Creation Tool (S.P.L.C.T.)
Intended Purpose : Create password lists based on root word & numbers

This is my learning to program program, my first written program.. So.. Theres that.

Any creative criticism is appreciated.

Planned additions: - capitalization of all letter combinations in root word
                   - have numbers both before and after root word
                   - substituting 'Leet Speak' chars in root word, EX: 31337h4xx0r
                   - importing word list files and adding numbers to the beginning & end of words
